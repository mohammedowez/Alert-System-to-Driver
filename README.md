# Alert-System-to-Driver
# --> Driver fatigue is a grave issue resulting in many road accidents each year. 
--> To evaluate the exact number of sleep related accidents because of the difficulties in detecting whether fatigue was a factor and in assessing the level of fatigue is not currently possible. 
--> In this project the camera will be placed besides the rare view mirror of car in such a way that it is in clear view of the frontal face of the driver. This camera will be continuously capture the video of driver’s frontal face while driving. The system will detect the frontal face and the eyes. The focus will be on the system that will accurately monitor the open or closed state of the driver’s eyes in real-time. 
--> If driver closes his eyes  driver alert system detects closed eyes and alert them before they fall asleep behind the wheel. The aim of this project is to prevent accidents.
